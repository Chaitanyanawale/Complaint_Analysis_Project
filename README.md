“In this project, I built a machine learning system on 311 service request data to predict complaint type, resolution time, and future complaint volume.
I performed data preprocessing, feature engineering, and trained classification, regression, and time-series models. 
Random Forest performed best for classification and regression tasks. 
This project helps city authorities proactively manage complaints, optimize resource allocation, and improve service efficiency.”
